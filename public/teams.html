    <p>The following teams are active in 2017. Click a team name for more information:</p>
                        <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(659)">Cast</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-659" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">The cast are made up of the actors, singers, and dancers (often all rolled into one) who perform on stage (and in videos) for the show. The cast are charged with power! The power to make the audience laugh, cheer, and lose control of their bowels every night.<br />
<br />
Being a member of cast requires a massive commitment, Life becomes an intense blur of rehearsals, promotions, and performing, with Directors poking you the whole way along (don't ask with what).<br />
<br />
BUT! Being in cast is also arguably the most rewarding and exciting thing that you will ever do with your life ever! Making hundreds of people laugh, getting to spend 3 months with a bunch of awesome people, making friends that will last a lifetime, and making a very special contribution to this crazy ol thing we call CSE Revue.<br />
<br />
Sounds like something you want to do? The wonderful thing about revue is to be in cast NO EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED! You don't have to be the loudest or funniest person in the world either, we'll teach you all the wicked skills you'll need. All we need from you is your dedication, enthusiasm, and luurve.<br />
<br />
</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(673)">Tech</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-673" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">The Tech team construct the props and the sets for the show, from massive spinning fans, to doors and giant pieces of a monopoly set. During the show Techies operate lights and sound, run around like cockroaches setting the stage and play with the fog machine.<br />
<br />
The only skills necessary are a good appreciation of teamwork and enjoyment of hanging around with others. If you have any experience with lighting, sound, set construction and related skills you'd be a particularly welcome member of the team. Tech consumes about 8 hours a week for the six weeks before show, and up to every show night depending on your interest. But hey, paint doesn't dry very well in the dark, so they'll knock off at sun down and hit the pub.<br />
<br />
Tech is a great place to pick up some fantastic skills, working in the dark with a team of people, potentially making  split-second decisions which directly effect the show each night. You'll learn some painting and construction alongside the in's and outs of theatre. Although you might not operate a light/sound/video console for your first show you'll have the opportunity to watch and assist others in this task.</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(658)">Band</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-658" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">The band are the masters of sound and music. As a member you will be part of the atmosphere and intrigue surrounding dances and skits. The band is also given time to shine in the  illustrious band number - a highlight of any revue. They also have a great time, with a reputation for partying harder and faster than any that have come before.<br />
<br />
Band puts in a dozen or so rehearsals and the four performance nights in session 2. Outside of that, the band is always looking for ways to avoid work, chill, and jam the night away. If you are an aspiring band member then you will need to bring your own instrument along with the best musical talent you can muster.<br />
</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(674)">Videos</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-674" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">The Videos team takes ideas and scripts that are too hard to do on stage (or can be done much better through a lens) and uses professional equipment to make them come to life on the screen.<br />
<br />
We'll teach you everything you need to know about film making; from script writing, creating a storyboard, all elements of production as well as introducing you to the post production world of editing and effects, there's always something to learn and be a part of. If you're a budding cinematographer, 3D animator or if you've just seen far too many movies, we'd love to have you on board. Everyone, regardless of skill level, is welcome to join us in creating something that will get us and our audiences giggling.</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(671)">Scripts</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-671" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">The scripts team is home to the writers, the visionaries, the loud, the quiet, the offensive, the politically correct, the good, the bad, and the directors. And of course, YOU!<br />
<br />
The scripts team pump the show full of goodness in the form of comedy. We play games, talk loudly, brainstorm, discuss ideas, and when the time is write, we right material for the show!<br />
<br />
No previous writing experience is necessary, and you don’t have to be the world’s funniest person to enter! Scripts is a network and community, a giant mish mash of people and ideas from which amazing things always emerge.<br />
<br />
Scripts is a great way to get mixed up in this crazy thing called revue in session 1, and to be involved right from the word go. It’s also a wonderful way to get to know the people in CSE revue before the show starts to gear up. If something you wrote/suggested ends up in show, you can tell/gloat to all your friends about it!<br />
<br />
And if you really, really don’t want to be involved in scripts, please come to a meeting and tell us why not.</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(660)">Costumes and Makeup</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-660" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">The Costumes team is responsible for adding that extra oomph on stage; making the cast look their sparkly best, for dressing up the Promotions team with costumes to make people turn and stare, and of course having awesome fun making the rest of Revue look so damn good (oh yeah)! Costumes is a great team to join for helping out behind the scenes with the added bonus that you get to see the products of your creation on stage!<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if you don't know how to sew. CSE's Costumes Team is a great place for learning some fundamental aspects of theatre costume design, practicing sewing skills, recapturing your youth and going back to those days of glitter-glue and finger-painting. <br />
<br />
If you have a bit of creative flair for designing eye-catching costumes, a weakness for the (oh so sexy) rev of those sewing machines, and are an absolute artiste with a pair of scissors in hand or are just interested in learning and creating things that will turn up on stage then Costumes is the team for you.</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(667)">Promotions and Marketing</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-667" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">Promotions and Marketing is responsible for raising awareness of CSE Revue. Essentially, we encourage people to see the show to support our friends.<br />
<br />
This year, we are revamping Promos. Basically, if you like to act and/or have fun, promos is for you! It's like cast but with less commitment. (BTW If you're in cast, you're automatically in promos). We will be doing plenty of interesting events to have laughs and convince people to watch the awesome show!<br />
<br />
Join the team if you want a story to tell and a fun adventure to experience.<br />
</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(663)">Front of House and Sales</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-663" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">Front of House (a.k.a FoH) is all about keeping the audience happy. FoH make sure they are entertained before the show begins, provide them with food and drink, give them a band to listen to and show them to their seats. FoH ensure the audience come away from an enjoyable experience all around. FoH members enjoy socialising, talking and making people happy. FoH also attracts people with an eye for detail - the decorators among you will be responsible for the theatre decorations.<br />
<br />
The Front of House Team will also be involved in filling the showbags we give to our audience with goodies. This means finding cool free things to hand out...everyone loves free stuff!<br />
<br />
You can also join other teams that don't operate during show nights - that means being part of the whole CSE Revue experience without giving your time entirely to one team. And the big bonus? The chance to see the show for free. Yes, that's right, free!</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(662)">Design</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-662" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;"><p>The Design team are responsible for the look and feel of CSE Revue's many visual expressions including the website, T-shirts, stage set, newsletters, program and much more. Design help present the image of CSE Revue to the world: our members, audience, sponsors and many random passers-by.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The Design is a highly creative, dynamic team requiring time and dedication. You don't need prior skills or experience (although they're most welcome) but a creative bent is a plus. You'll learn how to use the tools of the trade along with some theory behind effective visual design.</p><br />
<br />
<p>So whether you like drawing, painting, sketching, cartoons or just seeing your ideas make it to the public, the Design team is the place to be seen.</p></div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(677)">Webmin</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-677" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">Ever wanted to take part in a challenging and exciting technical projects? Whether or not you possess technical skills, the webmin is for you.<br />
<br />
The webmin (Website and administration) team is responsible for designing, developing and maintaining the CSE Revue website and mailing lists, as well as the related ticketing system which has been used in a number of on campus productions. As well as this we are in charge of the technical administration behind CSE Revue.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't have any programming skill, you can still be of valuable contribution in design (both art & user interface), feature ideas, and content contribution. That said, we also run lessons for those interested in learning how to make dynamic database driven websites.<br />
<br />
The following skills are useful if you are considering joining (but we teach you as well!):<br />
<ul><li>Willingness to learn</li><br />
<li>HTML</li><br />

<li>PHP</li><br />
<li>Scripting skills (esp. Perl)</li><br />

</div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(672)">Socials</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-672" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">Social is the FUN factory of CSE Revue! Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory we make it so that everyone is incorporated in the ride of Revue, enjoys fun times and takes away an abundance of memories. Being part of the social team means taking care of the little details to make Revue parties and the myriad other events each a raving success. You'll get to meet and greet lots of new and exciting people, and you might pick up some organisational skills on the way.<br><br>If you want to come up with super-cool events to put on or you're just looking to make new friends, you'll fit right into this cosy little team. "But what about the time commitment?" you might ask. Well that's up to you. The Social team is active all year round. So if you want to come up with fun, fresh ideas for social activities, the not-so-secret password is just a smile. Hyperactivity is optional.<br></div>
                                <div style="padding-left: 20px;"><h4><a onclick="toggleTeam(678)">Wellbeing</a></h4></div>
            <div id="team-678" style="display: none;padding-left: 20px;">Wellbeing is all about food and health!<br />
Delicious, life nurturing food and general health.<br />
<br />
As a member of the kind Wellbeing team, you'll be looking after the cast and crew involved in the show by assisting a team to cook for forty humans! hahaha, just kidding. Try a hundred and forty.<br />
<br />
Don't think you'll need cooking talents in any sense (but if you have them - awesome! you can teach us a thing or two).<br />
We guarantee a hilarious time experimenting with recipes, watching kitchens being reduced to ashes, and having a celebratory shindig when something edible happens to pop out of the stove!<br />
<br />
All we need is a few of your hours in the evening whenever you can spare them, whether you're going dice happy with the meat and vege, teaching/learning a new recipe, or if you think moral support's your strong suit.<br />
<br />
Wellbeing's also one of the more casual teams in terms of time commitment, so help out on any nights that you'd like. But you should know, the more often you appear through the doors, carrying hot, mouth watering food, the more everyone involved in the show will love you. <br />
<br />
Don't think that we only cook during Show and Production Weeks!<br />
We also have social Cooking sessions, and the occassional Cooking class, but most of all, we also look after camp! But it's not as if you're there to cook for everyone, you'll be at camp not only for the social activities, but also as a team member that facilitates Revue campers cook everyones meals on a rotational basis. </div>
